The objective of these extensions is to provide instant search functionality via a greasemonkey chrome extension.
To test out the plugins, check out these urls:
	
msdn-instant-search.user.js = http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Search
Download from: http://github.com/LordIllidan/Instant-Search-extensions/raw/master/msdn-instant-search.user.js

bing-instant-search.user.js = http://www.bing.com
Download from: http://github.com/LordIllidan/Instant-Search-extensions/raw/master/bing-instant-search.user.js

Please note that these plugins are still under development and may be buggy.

Caching functionality has also been implemented in order to improve performance. The plugin is slow
on MSDN due to the slower performance of the MSDN search engine.
