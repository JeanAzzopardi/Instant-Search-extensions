The objective of these extensions is to provide instant search functionality via a greasemonkey chrome extension.
Installing the extensions should be done by following these steps:
	1. Download the source folder from http://github.com/LordIllidan/Instant-Search-extensions/archives/master as ZIP.
	2. Unzip the source folder 
	3. Drag and drop the extension you want onto Chrome.

To test out the plugins, check out these urls:
	
msdn-instant-search.user.js = http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Search
bing-instant-search.user.js = http://www.bing.com

Please note that these plugins are still under development and may be buggy.

Caching functionality has also been implemented in order to improve performance. The plugin is slow
on MSDN due to the slower performance of the MSDN search engine.
